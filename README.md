If you have ever wondered how to program a simple chess app for yourself,
this tutorial is the right starting point.

We are going to explore the machanics of the game, how to maintain and display the game status,
and how to find a good next move.

To that goal we we'll also dive into data structures (*lists, trees, graphs*),
and explore some basic search algorithms based on these data structures.

After working through this tutorial, you will not only have a running chess app,
but also will be proficient in playing chess at an amateur level.
